                            <p>I'm a <strong>Design Technologist</strong>, but there's about 10 different names for what I do. I just tell my family members that I do a mixture of programming and design. <a href="https://irohdesign.github.io/" target="_blank">Here's my portfolio</a>.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>I interned at Intuit in Summer 2022, building a Figma plugin in Typescript. I'll be returning as a full-time Design Technologist in August 2023.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>I work mostly with Javascript in the React library, but I also do the front end stuff (HTML/CSS) and some things deeper in the stack. My actual certificate in software development is in the Full Stack. I'm kind of all over the place with my coding, like most engineers.</p>
                            <p>If you have any issues with Git, HTML/CSS, or anything like that, I'm happy to chat and would love to help out as my peer teaching opportunity. Just message me on the class Discord - I'm jevans.</p>

                            <p>I've always wanted to explore fabrication and physical engineering, and I'm so excited for this class. I'm building a workshop in my apartment right now, and I'll be getting into 3D printing, electronics, and woodworking.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p>I love Dungeons & Dragons, William Osman, and Simone Giertz. I'm always down to talk about building stuff, especially if it's weird.</p></li>
