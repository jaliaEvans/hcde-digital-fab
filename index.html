<!-- For the class, you will be keeping track of your progress on a publicly viewable website. You will manage your website with the version control software Git, using Github.

For the first assignment, you will set up your webpage. Your page needs to exist as a github repository and served through github pagesLinks to an external site.. If you're not sure how to get started with designing a webpage for this, you can use this templateLinks to an external site..

On your page, please introduce yourself briefly! E.g. Who are you? Why do you want to learn about digital fabrication? What do you hope to learn in the class? What do you want to teach your peers?

You will have links from your main page to each assignment. There will be assignments due every week.

Please submit the URL to your main page on canvas. Then each week you will submit a url that is linked to from your main page, e.g. assignment2.html, etc.

FAQ!

                            <p>I'm a <strong>Design Technologist</strong>, but there's about 10 different names for what I do. I just tell my family members that I do a mixture of programming and design. <a href="https://irohdesign.github.io/" target="_blank">Here's my portfolio</a>.</p>

                            <p>I interned at Intuit in Summer 2022, building a Figma plugin in Typescript. I'll be returning as a full-time Design Technologist in August 2023.</p>

                            <p>I work mostly with Javascript in the React library, but I also do the front end stuff (HTML/CSS) and some things deeper in the stack. My actual certificate in software development is in the Full Stack. I'm kind of all over the place with my coding, like most engineers.</p>
                            <p><strong>If you have any issues with Git, HTML/CSS, or anything like that, I'm happy to chat and would love to help out as my peer teaching opportunity. Just message me on the class Discord - I'm jevans.</strong></p>

                            <p>I've always wanted to explore fabrication and physical engineering, and I'm so excited for this class. I'm building a workshop in my apartment right now, and I'll be getting into 3D printing, electronics, and woodworking.</p>

                        <li>I love Dungeons & Dragons, William Osman, and Simone Giertz. I'm always down to talk about building stuff, especially if it's weird.</li>
