                        <h4>Build the lamp</h4>
                        <p>My first idea for the lamp was to create a version of the disintegration ray from Duck Dodgers, but I ended up hating that design once I'd built it. I 3D printed an oval shaped container for the light and was planning on using acrylic to conduct the light outwards, but it just wouldn't look how I wanted and I didn't like seeing the lines from the 3D print.</p>
                        
                        <p>I decided to pivot to a new design, and I'm very happy I did.</p>

                        <h5>Plan B</h5>
                        <p>I've been planning on using acrylic for  my final project, so I wanted to use this assignment as a chance to test it out. I struggled with tolerance during the CNC assignment, so I focused very intensely on getting the box to have perfect right angles and made them sit flush by having a smaller piece attached to the lightbulb adapter. All of the sides sit tightly against the bottom's spacer plate.</p>
                        <p>I made a prototype by taping together pieces of acrylic scrap because I didn't want to commit to the plan if I didn't like the potential end result. I ended up loving it and designed the lamp in Rhino for perfect cuts.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>I cut my materials and used the scrap from those cuts to make L's that I glued together to form right angle supports. I used hot glue to assemble them for testing, then cleaned the excess glue off with a chisel. I used acrylic adhesive to bond them for the long term.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>I'm very glad that I had the idea for the supports, because they made assembling the box itself so much easier. I did a dry fit of the laser cut parts before assembling the box with adhesive.</p>
                        <p>I have definitely roughed up my hands this quarter with my building methods. I can be a little reckless. I made sure to wear gloves while using the adhesive, which I'm VERY GLAD ABOUT because the adhesive splashed onto my desk when I cut the can open. Thankfully, I have a silicone pad on my desk already.</p>
                        <p>I glued the box together with the adhesive, thankful that I had the right angle supports to figure out how to use the adhesive. I expected it to be closer consistency to caulk, but it was a pure liquid. It had a bit of a learning curve, but I'm glad I learned it before I start my final project.</p>

                        <p>The adhesive cured very quickly, and now I have an acrylic cube lamp!</p>
                        <p>There are two open faces on the sides to install and uninstall the lightbulb. I think the light looks more interesting with two open sides. The box has the proper clearance for heat management of a LED bulb and an app controls its colors/brightness.</p>
                        <p>I made sure to use the acrylic adhesive to solidly attach the top to the two vertical sides because I knew it would be holding the weight of the light.</p>
                        <p>I'm really enjoying this lamp and I'm so glad I had the opportunity to learn with it. I can't wait to work with acrylic again in my final project, and I'm sure that I'll keep working with it as my preferred medium long term.</p>

                        <h4>Build the Mold</h4>
                        <p>I decided to design a lotion bar for my two-part mold. I wanted to make sure I was making a mold that I would use repeatedly because silicone isn't cheap. I knew that lotion bars would be great stocking stuffers for Christmas, and if my family likes them, I might sell them online or at a local craft fair. I've made lotion for myself occasionally because I grew up with eczema. It's a nice and relaxing thing to make.</p>

                        <br>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-7">
                                <p>I wanted to personalize the bars, so I added a design to the top. I love Avatar the Last Airbender and remembered the Order of the White Lotus' calling card. It is a white lotus embossed playing piece from a game on the show. I thought the symbol was cute for cosmetics, but also subtle enough for non-fans to enjoy.</p>
                                <p>I made the bar by creating a box in Rhino and filleting the edges. Sharp edges on a lotion bar wouldn't be good for applying it and I think it looks nicer with the rounded edges.</p>
                                <p>I took <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4008084">this STL</a>, repaired the mesh, resized it and joined it with the lotion bar container.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                            <div class="col-md-7">
                                <p>I modeled the mold in Rhino, then printed them overnight. Each side took about 6 hours, and I had to do one reprint. I realized after the first print that the spout didn't extend all the way to the border of the box, so I extended it. Shoutout to Tomomi's design for making me realize it.</p>
                                <p>I was worried that the lotus wouldn't come out well, but I think it looks great!</p>
                                <p>I'll be pouring my silicone tomorrow morning and hopefully it'll be cured by late tomorrow night.</p>
                                <p>I was going to cast all of them in plaster, but I thought it might be a waste of material if I just tossed them out afterwards. I'm going to cast in plaster once to make sure it works, then I have to leave for Thanksgiving (and I don't think TSA will be cool with me traveling with a baggie of white powder).</p>
                                <p>I'm planning on making one cast with the plaster from the MILL, but then I'm planning on casting it with a lotion recipe I have.</p>
