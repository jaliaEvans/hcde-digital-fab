                        <p>I'm not sure why, but I just couldn't get the hang of the CNC, and I was too stubborn to switch to the 3D printed version because I've been in love with CNCs for years.</p>
                        <p>Oh, sweet hubris.</p>

                        <h4>Draw toolpath</h4>
                        <p>I like to use components when I'm drawing shapes in Rhino. It's nice to be able to pick pieces up again when I need to create a shape. I used the CurveBoolean function when joining and trimming, so I couldn't grab a shape once it was cut.</p>

                        <h5>Measuring</h5>
                        <p>I made sure to measure my material with the calipers every time I switched out a plate to make sure that the slots would line up correctly.</p>
                        <p>I drew probably about 30 different shapes throughout the process, then uploaded my final designs to the documentation on Github.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h4>Test out the CNC</h4>
                        <p>I was so excited to get to play with a CNC. Xenia and I had a great time cutting a 2mm square, and it was so amazing. I nerded out for about 30 minutes afterwards.</p>
                        
                        <p>We used the 1/32" end mill, or 0.79375mm, and I made sure to measure the end mill along with the materials, since you never know if it could have a problem.</p>

                        <p>I still love the CNC, I just am now appropriately respectful of it and humbled by its grace.</p>

                        <h4>Cut the shapes</h4>
                        <p>This was where the mayhem started.</p>
                        <p>I must have gone through 20 sheets of material between all of the trial and error of this assignment. I must say that I have learned that I will fight tooth and nail to use CNCs that can have the material screwed in place, or will invent a double-sided tape dispenser SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS MACHINE.</p>
                        <p>I cannot emphasize how much issue I had with the tape. I used the vacuums, I wiped it with a paper towel, I prayed to every grad school God I could think of. I got the shapes done, but at what cost?</p>

                        <h5>Lessons in humility and exhaustion</h5>
                        <p>I'm not really sure what was going on with me this week, but I just couldn't get anything to work right. I'm pretty sure I looked like an insane person, sitting in the MILL for hours with a comfort can of Pringles and Powerade.</p>
                        <p>I finally managed to get a four-sided cube to work, having gotten the hang of the dogbones and the margins, but I couldn't get the top and bottom to fit. I'm certain now that I need to increase the cut on the bottom portions of my slot edges to accomodate for the extra height of the bottom and top pieces.</p>
                        <p>I'm definitely going to return to the MILL after this week and figure out the final toolpaths, but for now, I've got a four-sided box.</p>
